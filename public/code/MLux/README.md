A PyTorch platform for training and experimenting with neural networks.

- **Bigram model** — a simple neural network that learns character-to-character transition probabilities
- **LSTM model** — a recurrent neural network capable of learning longer-range character sequences using memory and context
- **GRU model** — a gated recurrent unit network for efficient sequence modeling with fewer parameters than LSTM
- **Transformer model** — a trainable transformer supporting both training and generation
- **DistilGPT2 model** — inference-only; uses a pre-trained Hugging Face transformer for high-quality text generation

The codebase is modular, config-driven, and supports training, checkpointing, early stopping, hyperparameter tuning, and generation from any model via CLI. Comprehensive unit tests are included for all major modules, including training, library, utilities, visualization, tuning, CLI, model behavior, and profiling (**current coverage**: 100%).

## Model Architectures

### Bigram Model

A lightweight model that uses an embedding table to predict the next character from the current character only. Fast and simple, but limited in predictive capability.

### LSTM Model

A recurrent neural network using embedding, multi-layer LSTM, and projection back to vocab size. Learns long-range dependencies across sequences for improved generation.

### GRU Model

A gated recurrent unit network that efficiently models sequences with fewer parameters than LSTM, providing a balance between speed and performance.

### Transformer Model

A trainable transformer model using self-attention mechanisms for sophisticated text generation. Architecture includes token and position embeddings, multi-head attention, feedforward layers, and stacking of encoder layers.

### DistilGPT2 Model

Integration with a pre-trained Hugging Face DistilGPT2 model for high-quality text generation. **Inference-only** (cannot be trained or fine-tuned).

## Datasets

Three types of datasets are supported:

### Local Dataset

The `dataset/` directory (included in this repo) contains **100 filtered sample texts** for training, preprocessed from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). These texts have been cleaned and filtered using length, markup, and English word ratio heuristics.

For more training data, you can download the **full cleaned dataset (4,437 books)** [on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yosna/Project-Gutenberg-Training-Data).

### Built-in Library

The project includes a pre-configured library of datasets:

- **News** (0.03 GB) - AG News dataset
- **Science** (0.41 GB) - PubMed QA dataset
- **Movies** (0.49 GB) - IMDB dataset
- **Yelp** (0.51 GB) - Yelp Review Full dataset
- **SQuAD** (0.08 GB) - Stanford Question Answering Dataset
- **Tiny Stories** (1.89 GB) - Tiny Stories dataset
- **Stack Overflow** (5.75 GB) - Stack Overflow Questions dataset
- **Wikipedia** (18.81 GB) - English Wikipedia dataset

### Custom Hugging Face Datasets

You can use any dataset from the Hugging Face Hub by specifying the dataset name and configuration in `config.json`. This allows for flexible experimentation with different text sources.

## Configuration

All behavior is driven by a single `config.json` file. You can edit this file manually or with the user-friendly [Configuration Editor](#configuration-editor).

## Configuration Editor

An interactive GUI for editing `config.json` is included to simplify configuration management.

- Launch with:
  ```bash
  python -m run config
  ```
- This will open a window where you can view and modify all settings from `config.json`.
- The config editor supports saving changes back to the file.
- [DearPyGui](https://dearpygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used to build the editor.

## Pipeline GUI

A comprehensive end-to-end graphical interface for managing the entire model lifecycle, from selection to training, evaluation, and export.

- Launch with:
  ```bash
  python -m run pipeline
  ```
- Features:
  - **Model Selection**: Choose from Bigram, LSTM, GRU, or Transformer models
  - **Training Control**: Start and stop model training with real-time progress monitoring
  - **Evaluation Mode**: Run trained models for text generation
  - **Integrated Terminal**: Built-in terminal window for logging and debugging output
  - **Configuration Editor**: Access the config editor directly from the pipeline interface
  - **Model Export**: Export models in various formats (see [Model Export](#model-export))
  - **Real-time Updates**: Live updates of training progress and terminal output

The pipeline GUI provides a unified interface for all model operations, making it easy to manage training workflows without switching between command-line tools.

## Model Export

The project includes a comprehensive model export system that allows you to export trained models in multiple formats for different use cases.

### Export Formats

1. **Architecture Export**

   - Exports the model architecture as a standalone Python module
   - Includes the model's hyperparameters from `config.json`
   - Generates a complete, runnable Python file with the model class and hyperparameter dataclass
   - Useful for sharing model architectures or using them in other projects

2. **Package Export**

   - Bundles the trained model with all required dependencies using PyTorch's PackageExporter
   - Creates a `.pkg` file that can be loaded and used independently
   - Includes model weights, vocabulary mappings, and necessary code dependencies
   - Ideal for deployment or sharing trained models

3. **Framework Export**

   - Exports the model as a `.zip` file containing the package structure
   - Allows for custom framework development around the exported model
   - Provides more flexibility for building custom implementations

4. **Application Export**
   - Compiles models as standalone executable applications using PyInstaller
   - Creates executables for the platform where PyInstaller is run (Windows `.exe`, Linux, or macOS executables)
   - Includes model weights, vocabulary mappings, and all dependencies bundled into a single source
   - Applications are named based on the model and generation strategy (e.g., `transformer_random_generation`)

### Using Model Export

Model export is available through both the Pipeline GUI and the CLI:

**Pipeline GUI:**

1. Launch the pipeline: `python -m run pipeline`
2. Select a model to export
3. Choose an export format from the export menu
4. The exported files will be saved to the `exports/` directory

**CLI:**
Export models directly from the command line using the `--export` argument:

```bash
python main.py --model transformer --export architecture
python main.py --model lstm --export package
python main.py --model gru --export framework
python main.py --model transformer --export application
```

Exports are organized by format followed by model name.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Automatic hyperparameter tuning is supported via [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).

- Enable tuning by setting `"auto_tuning": true` in `config.json`.
- Define search spaces in the `"tuning_ranges"` section (supports `int`, `float`, and `categorical` types).
- Tuning is integrated into the training workflow and can be controlled via the CLI or config.
- Results are saved and can be used to update model hyperparameters automatically if `"save_tuning": true`.
- Tunable fields include: `batch_size`, `block_size`, `lr`, `embedding_dim`, `hidden_size`, `num_layers`, `max_seq_len`, `num_heads`, `ff_dim`.
- Pruners and tuning options are configurable in `config.json`.

## Optuna Dashboard

Visualize your hyperparameter optimization studies interactively with Optuna Dashboard.

- Launch with:
  ```bash
  python -m run dashboard
  ```
- The dashboard will open at **localhost:8080**.
- Requires `optuna-dashboard` (install with `pip install optuna-dashboard`).
- Shows study history, parameter importance, and more.

## Profiling

A built-in profiling tool is included to help you analyze performance bottlenecks in your code.

- The profiler is located at `run/profiler.py` and is accessible via the modular run package.
- It runs the main application under `cProfile` and saves filtered, timestamped reports to `profiles/`.
- Reports are filtered to exclude virtual environment and bootstrap code, and show the top functions by calls, time, and cumulative time.
- You can run the profiler with:
  ```bash
  python -m run profiler
  ```
- You can also import and use the profiler programmatically in your own scripts or tests.
- The profiling tool is unit tested with 100% coverage.

## Usage

### Pipeline GUI

The easiest way to interact with the project is through the Pipeline GUI, which provides a unified interface for all operations:

```bash
python -m run pipeline
```

This launches a graphical interface where you can:

- Select models
- Start/stop training
- Run evaluations
- Export models
- View real-time logs and progress

### Command Line Interface

For programmatic control, the project provides a flexible CLI for controlling model options, runtime and hyperparameters, tuning options, visualization, and exports:

- **Generator Options** (`--generator`, `--prompt`, `--context-length`, ...)
- **Model Options** (`--save-model`, `--token-level`, `patience`...)
- **Runtime** (`--training`, `--steps`, `--interval`, ...)
- **Hyperparameters** (`--batch-size`, `--block-size`, `--lr`, ...)
- **Tuning Options** (`--auto-tuning`, `--save-tuning`, `--save-study`, ...)
- **Visualization** (`--save-plot`, `--show-plot`, `--smooth-loss`, ...)
- **Export** (`--export`)

#### Notes

- The model argument will default to `--model transformer` if omitted.
- Any arguments omitted will default to the respective value defined in `config.json`.
- Boolean flags support flexible input: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, `1`, `0`.
- **distilgpt2** uses a pre-trained Hugging Face model and is inference-only (cannot be trained).

### Train a model

```bash
# Train the Transformer model
python main.py --model transformer --training true
```

### Generate text

After training, switch to generation mode by setting `"training": false` inside the appropriate section of `config.json`:

```json
"training": false
```

Then run the same command to generate text:

```bash
python main.py --model transformer
```

The project supports two text generation strategies:

1. **Random Generation** (`"generator": "random"`): Starts with a randomly selected seed character/word and generates text from there
2. **Prompt-Based Generation** (`"generator": "prompt"`): Uses a user-provided prompt and generates text continuing from that prompt

You can control the randomness of generation using the `temperature` argument in `config.json`. Lower values make output more deterministic; higher values make it more random.

For prompt-based generation, you can also configure the `context_length` to control how much of the prompt history is used for generating the next token.

## Loss Visualization

- Plotting both training and validation loss curves
- Optional exponential smoothing for clearer trends
- Saving plots with timestamped filenames to a model-specific directory
- Configurable via `config.json`

## GPU Acceleration

- GPU acceleration is used by default if a CUDA device is available.

## Dependencies

### Production Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch
- matplotlib
- datasets (Hugging Face)
- transformers (DistilGPT2)
- optuna (for hyperparameter tuning)
- dearpygui (for configuration editor and pipeline GUI)
- PyInstaller (for application export)

Install all production dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development Dependencies

For development, testing, and linting, additional dependencies are available:

- pytest (for unit testing)
- pytest-cov (for coverage reporting)
- coverage (for code coverage analysis)
- flake8 (for code linting)
- flake8-docstrings (for docstring style checking)
- isort (for import sorting)

Install development dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Or install both production and development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Note:**  
The `torch` package in `requirements.txt` is the CPU version of PyTorch.  
If you want to use a GPU, it is recommended to **install the appropriate CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch** for your system **before running** `pip install -r requirements.txt` for a quicker install.  
You can find the correct install command for your system and CUDA version at the [official PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

For example, to install PyTorch with CUDA 12.8 support:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

## Docker Usage

You can run this project in a Docker container for a fully isolated and reproducible environment.

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```

### Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run --rm -it <your-image-name>:latest
```

### Notes

- The provided `Dockerfile` uses the `python:3.11-slim` base image for a smaller footprint.
- It explicitly installs the **CPU-only** version of PyTorch to avoid large image sizes. If you need GPU support, modify the Dockerfile and requirements accordingly.
- The `.dockerignore` file is configured to exclude unnecessary files (such as datasets, checkpoints, and virtual environments) from the image. If you add new large files or folders, update `.dockerignore` to keep your image size small.
- If you encounter issues with image size, check that you are not copying large files or using the GPU version of torch by accident.

You can modify the `CMD` in the Dockerfile to run other scripts or pass arguments as needed.

## Testing

- The project includes comprehensive unit tests for all major modules: training, datasets, utility functions, loss visualization, tuning, model/CLI behavior, profiling, pipeline, UI components, services, and model export.
- Tests are written using `pytest` with `coverage` for reporting. Both are included in `requirements-dev.txt`
- All unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory.
- **Statistics**: 347 unit tests, 100% coverage, 1875 stmts / 0 miss
- To run all tests:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- To check coverage:
  ```bash
  coverage run -m pytest
  coverage report -m
  ```
- You can also run a specific test file, for example:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/test_ui.py
  ```
- Test output will show which tests passed or failed, and coverage will report which lines are tested.
- Coverage includes data processing, plotting, model logic, CLI argument parsing, tuning, profiling, pipeline GUI, UI components, services (architecture, exporter, terminal, callbacks), and more.
  - Logger/debug lines are excluded from coverage analysis (see `.coveragerc`/`pyproject.toml`).

## Future Improvements

- Add learning rate scheduling during training
- Add visualization for transformer attention
- Add beam search to model generation
- Expand model sampling and generation options
